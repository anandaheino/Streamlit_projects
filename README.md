# Streamlit projects
## I'll be using this repository to: 
- practice Streamlit
- build small projects to understand how the tool works :)
## Preparing the environment:
- Using anaconda: 
  - ```conda create -n streamlit_projects``` 
  - ```conda activate streamlit_projects```
- trying to install packages (at this order):
  1) ```pip install <lib>``` 
  2) ```conda install <lib>```
  3) ```conda install -c conda-forge  <lib>```

- Other libs (installed with pip):
  - **streamlit**
  - statsmodels
  - yfinance
